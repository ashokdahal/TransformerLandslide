[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/743599863.svg)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10514292)

The codes required for our paper "Transformers, more than meets the eye: employing full waveforms for coseismic landslide prediction"
Please run all the models (e.g. Mod1, Mod2, Mod3..) from the TransformerModel and StaticModel notebooks. you can decide on which parameter files to use. For the dataset required please follow the paper to access the data.
